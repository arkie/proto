This repo contains a number of disparate code sketches -- largely to cut down on the number of abandoned, largely unusable repos in github.

###1%
 - Node.js twitter stream, predates node.joncaldwell.com

###baad
 - Webkit with transparency

###glomp
 - Node playground (destination: microframework?)

###jiki
 - example ni (see below) project for a simple wiki-like site.

###ni
 - (abandoned) Web framework development, yeah! Reinventing the wheel, yeah! (Supports appengine, tornado.py)

###shill
 - (abandoned) Interactive shell sites, or how I learned to stop coding and love the cloud. 
 - Google App Engine based interactive shell (Although potentially generic Â± some models)
   Ideally, with persistence per url, maybe with a key of some sort?

###shing
 - (abandoned) Minor tile engine for Android-based RPGs

###simplex
 - (abandoned) Simple node-based (read wiki) site for Google App Engine

###space
 - Spinning ships with a node.js socket.io (echo) server behind.
