This repo contains a number of disparate code sketches -- largely to cut down on the number of abandoned, largely unusable branches in github.

baad
 - Webkit with transparency

simplex
 - (abandoned) Simple node-based (read wiki) site for Google App Engine

shill
 - (abandoned) Interactive shell sites, or how I learned to stop coding and love the cloud. 
 - Google App Engine based interactive shell (Although potentially generic Â± some models)
   Ideally, with persistence per url, maybe with a key of some sort?
